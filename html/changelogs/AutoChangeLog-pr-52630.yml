  - rscadd: "Roboticists and engineers rejoice. NanoTrasen has decided to cut back on training costs through leveraging emerging technologies. All roboticists and engineers start with tiny little microchips implanted deep in their brains that unlock forbidden knowledge about wire assignments."
  - rscadd: "Roboticists with their job skillchip can now identify cyborg wires while engineers with their job skillchip can now identify airlock and APC wires. Highly select blueprint-based knowledge implanted directly into your brain."
  - rscadd: "The Research Director and Chief Engineer now have a box containing a couple of spare copies of their respective department's skill chips tucked nearly away in their secure lockers. Feel free to implant yourselves - As the most competent and highly respected members of your respective departments, we're sure you're earned it..."
  - rscadd: "Traitors not left out of the loop either, they can now purchase a highly advanced Syndicate skillchip for 4TC that contains data a number of key skillchips. This so-called \"chameleon\" chip will enable you to inflitrate other departments or take full advantage of the powers the skillchips have to offer; just remember to extract your own job skillchips first at any library before going undercover if you want your own chameleon chip to work."
  - rscadd: "Changelings rejoice, for you now absorb the skill chips of your targets when you transform. Beware, though - You'll lose all your existing ones in the process. A truly double-edged armblade."
  - rscadd: "Delta and Pubby now have Skill Stations in their respective libraries, next to the games vending machines."
  - tweak: "Skill Station has recieved a fresh coat of interface paint."
